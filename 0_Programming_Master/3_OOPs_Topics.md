# 🔷 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Complete Topic List

A language-independent guide for mastering OOP — essential for development, interviews, and system design.

---

## 🧩 1. Introduction to OOP
- What is OOP?
- Benefits of OOP over Procedural Programming
- Real-world analogies (e.g., Car as Object)

---

## 🧱 2. Class and Object
- Definition of Class
- Creating Objects from a Class
- Members: Variables + Functions
- Accessing members using object
- Constructor and Destructor
- `this` pointer (C++) / `self` (Python)

---

## 🛡️ 3. Access Specifiers / Modifiers
- `public`
- `private`
- `protected`
- Why access control matters?

---

## 📦 4. Encapsulation
- Wrapping data and methods into one unit
- Using private variables with getter/setter methods
- Data hiding and security

---

## 🎭 5. Abstraction
- Showing only essential details, hiding complexity
- Abstract Classes
- Pure Virtual Functions (C++)
- Interfaces (Java) / Abstract Base Classes (Python)

---

## 🧬 6. Inheritance
- Single Inheritance
- Multi-level Inheritance
- Multiple Inheritance
- Hierarchical Inheritance
- Hybrid Inheritance
- Constructor chaining
- Inheritance and access control

---

## 🧠 7. Polymorphism
### 🔹 Compile-Time Polymorphism
- Function Overloading
- Operator Overloading (C++ only)

### 🔸 Run-Time Polymorphism
- Function Overriding
- Virtual Functions (C++)
- Overriding in Python/Java
- VTables & Virtual Destructors

---

## 🧰 8. Constructor and Destructor
- Default Constructor
- Parameterized Constructor
- Copy Constructor
- Constructor Overloading
- Destructor in C++ / `__del__()` in Python

---

## 🔄 9. Static Members
- Static Variables
- Static Methods
- Accessing static members without object

---

## 🤝 10. Friend Functions / Classes (C++ only)
- Accessing private members
- When and why to use friend?

---

## 📤 11. Operator Overloading (C++)
- Overloading `+`, `-`, `==`, etc.
- Using `operator` keyword
- Limitations of operator overloading

---

## 🧪 12. OOP in Practice
- Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, etc.)
- OOP in Python, Java, C++, JavaScript
- OOP in Game Development / Robotics
- SOLID Principles
- Code Reusability and Maintenance

---

## 💬 13. OOP Interview Questions
- Differences: Overloading vs Overriding  
- Inheritance vs Composition  
- Abstract Class vs Interface  
- Why use Virtual Functions?  
- Real-world examples of OOP

---

📌 _Mastering OOP helps build robust, reusable, and scalable applications._
